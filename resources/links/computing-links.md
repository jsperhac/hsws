Sequencing ancient human genomes from the Himalayas (using supercomputers)
June 2016

"The Himalayas ... are very interesting in human evolution because: 
1) they represent a major barrier to gene flow, and 
2) habitation of these regions required major genetic adaptations. Thus ancient DNA can illuminate 
the history of migration and of adaptations."

...both prehistoric individuals and contemporary Tibetan populations share beneficial mutations in 
two genes implicated in adaptation to low-oxygen conditions found at high altitudes.
