## Paperscape: Visualizing Academic Paper Interrelationships

This is a visualization tool for the interrelationships between academic
papers on ArXiv. Each paper is represented by a circle. The size of the
circle is scaled by the number of citations, the color is related to the
subject area, and it's searchable (enter e.g. "?a p.zoller" to search on
one author). Click a circle to see information and links to that paper.
