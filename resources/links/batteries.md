In a breakthrough that could result in the development of washable, sensor-laden smart clothes and wearable electronics, researchers at the City University of Hong Kong have molded a rechargeable zinc-ion battery into an elastic yarn. The researchers made the thread-like rechargeable zinc battery by twisting carbon nanotube fibers into yarn. They note one piece of yarn is coated with zinc to make an anode and another with manganese dioxide to serve as a cathode. The team then wound the two yarn pieces on an elastic fiber, soaked it with a water-absorbing gel, and encased the device in elastic silicone and a water repellent. The yarn battery has an energy density of 54.8 milliwatt-hours for each cubic centimeter, equating to about three times as much as conventional thin-film lithium-ion batteries. In addition, the new battery retains more than 98 percent of its capacity after 500 recharging cycles.

#### Increasing battery life in electronic devices:

“A diode normally conducts current and voltage through the device along only one biasing direction, but when the voltage is reversed, the current stops. This switching process costs significant energy due to dissipation, or the depletion of the power source, thus affecting battery life. By substituting the semiconductor with a magnetic system, we believed we could create an energetically effective device that consumes much less power with enhanced functionalities.”
Singh’s team developed a two-dimensional, nanostructured material created by depositing a magnetic alloy, or permalloy, on the honeycomb structured template of a silicon surface. The new material conducts unidirectional current, or currents that only flow one way. The material also has significantly less dissipative power compared to a semiconducting diode, which is normally included in electronic devices.
The magnetic diode paves the way for new magnetic transistors and amplifiers that dissipate very little power, thus increasing the efficiency of the power source. This could mean that designers could increase the life of batteries by more than a hundred-fold. Less dissipative power in computer processors could also reduce the heat generated in laptop or desktop CPUs.
