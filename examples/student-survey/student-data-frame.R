# --------------------------------

# Exploring bad syntax, and good syntax, for 
# indexing into data frames:

# select subset of data frame having age < 17.
# try omitting the comma. What happens?
data[data$Age<17,]

# This should return a single value. What happens
# if you omit one of the row or column names? The comma?
data["Matt D","Hand"]

# what does this do? Why?
data$"Matt D"

# what does this do? Why?
data["Height"]

# why doesn't the same type of access work here:
data["Matt D"]

# any difference between these calls?
data[,]
data[]
data

# try these commands. What do they do?
summary(data$Height)
str(data$Height)

# select heights equal to 67 inches.
# How do you get the whole row instead?
# What happens (try this last) if you omit one of the =
# in the ==? Can you guess first?
data$Height[data$Height==74]

data$Height=74
# now what Heights are present in your dataset?

# --------------------------------

# write a function that accomplishes each of these ends:
#
# List heights and handedness of students at SJCI
# How many students are younger than 17?
# List names of students old enough to drive
# Convert all heights to centimeters, output a data frame
#   that contains name, height in cm, school. One inch is 2.54 cm.
