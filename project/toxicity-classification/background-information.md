## Uses of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles

Metal oxide nanoparticles have a variety of medical applications. They can be used in targeted drug delivery, allowing doctors to deliver
chemotherapy selectively and more effectively. They can be used as contrast agents in MRIs to improve imaging. They can be used to repair
or replace bones, and have potential applications in treating arthritis, spine injuries, and neurodegenerative diseases. They have also
been used as long-lasting, anti-microbial coatings on medical equipment.

## Potential Complications

However, metal nanoparticles can pose health risks of their own. In too high of a concentration, a patient could experience [metal 
poisoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_toxicity). As a result, it is important to be able to determine if a metal oxide
nanoparticle would be toxic before administering it to a patient or using it in a treatment.

## Classification

To determine if a metal oxide nanoparticle will be toxic or not, we can use a binary classification. A binary classification separates
elements in a data set into two categories, based on some particular feature. For the nanoparticles, we know whether or not the compound
is actually toxic, and have information on the cytotoxicity (the damage that the compound did to a population of cells). We can use this
information to determine a threshold for toxic versus non-toxic substances, and use that threshold to decide if a particular compound is 
worth investigating for use in a medical application.
