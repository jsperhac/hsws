## Battery Capacity

A battery's capacity is how long it is capable of providing charge at a specific discharge rate and time. Essentially, this means how long
the battery can be used before it needs to be recharged. Currently, lithium-ion batteries are ubiquitous in portable electronics, and have
also been used in applications such as electric cars. However, lithium-ion batteries are manufactured to maximize energy density at the [cost
of some safety](http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/archive/lithium_ion_safety_concerns), and consumers still want longer battery lifetimes 
[despite potential risks](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/09/02/samsung-battery-lithium-ion-fire-burning-explosion/89782856/). 
As a result, we want to find new compounds that have the highest capacity possible. Since there are a large number of potential combinations,
we would like to find what battery compounds theoretically have high capacities, rather than running an impractical number of experiments.

## Linear Regression and Extrapolation

To predict the capacities of new compounds, we can use an elemental property that's known to correlate well with capacity. We can perform a
linear regression to model the relationship between the elemental property and the battery capacity, and use that model to predict the capacity
of new, previously unexplored compounds.
