## Disk Drive Design

Currently, [rare earth elements](http://geology.com/articles/rare-earth-elements/) are used widely in hard drives among other applications. However, because these elements are difficult to mine economically and there are concerns over potential [supply shortages.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/20/opinion/the-next-resource-shortage.html) One of the ways that previous shortages were avoided was development of [different materials](https://www.technologyreview.com/s/535381/what-happened-to-the-rare-earths-crisis/) to replace rare earth metals. However, it is difficult to mimic favorable properties of these elements.

Huge amounts of data are generated daily, meaning that we would like to develop stable, cheap storage. In order to do this, you will be looking at new compounds, with a mix of rare earth and non-rare earth elements, that can be used to create hard drives. From these, you can screen for different desirable properties and decide on a new compound to make hard drives.
