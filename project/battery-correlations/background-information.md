## Battery Properties

A battery's capacity is how long it is capable of providing charge at a specific discharge rate and time. Essentially, this means how long
the battery can be used before it needs to be recharged. The voltage is the difference in electrical potential energy between two points.
We'd like to design batteries with as high of a capacity as possible, but the problem is complicated by [the variety of applications](http://www.brighthubengineering.com/power-generation-distribution/123909-types-of-batteries-and-their-applications/)
and potential trade-offs. No one battery design is suitable for every purpose, and the properties of the different elements may lead to 
trade-offs that impact the feasiblity of a design. 


## Correlations and Design Rules

Since there are a large number of potential battery compounds, it would be impractical to run experiments on each combination to see if it works.
Instead, we would like to narrow down the list of potential compounds that we plan to test by developing design rules. To do this, we 
can pick an application that we're interested in, determine what properties matter for that application, and use the correlations between
elemental and battery properties to find a few potential compounds worth testing. Some properties such as high capacity are universally
desirable; others, such as weight, may or may not matter, depending on the application.
