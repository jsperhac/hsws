## Car Design

In order to stay competitive, car companies are constantly looking for ways to make vehicles safer, faster, and more fuel efficient.
At the same time, they want to make cars as cheap as possible. One way to achieve this is to modify the material used for the car frame. 
The frame provides the general structure for the car, as well as being one of the main [safety features](https://www.carlawfirm.com/what-is-frame-car-damage) 
of any car. In particular, the amount that the car crumples impacts the safety. If the car crumples too much, it can harm the driver or 
passengers. On the other hand, if the car is able to withstand a hard impact, that force will be transferred to the people inside the car,
and can still cause injury. 

Careful selection of the material will allow us to design a car with desirable properties. To do this, you will be examining 
titanium-aluminum alloys with a third element as an additive. This additional element can have a large impact on the properties of the 
alloy. Therefore, your goal will be to decide on the properties that are important to your design, and using those to decide on the 
material to be used.
